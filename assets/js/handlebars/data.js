			description : "My first project for an organization. There was an already built resource center that wasn't user friendly at all and no one wanted to use it (me neither...). My goal? That anyone in need of help could go to this site and find what they needed or the way to get it. I redesign the whole platform (it was known as Wolf Resource Center 2.0... oh yeah!) and also keep updating it with relevant new information and features the users asked for.",

			description : "My team recognized that the other project I did (please see my other project: Wolf Resource Center) was having success and the program directors where using it. So we faced another issue: the members of the committes weren't able to access training material or resources for basic processes, so with the national team we came to the idea of making this platform: Wolf Academy. Here was all the information, videos, trainings, memes (and more!) needed so the members in charge of developing the Global Internship Program could develop their work. The platform was such a hit that the National Board started implementing it in the other areas of the orgranization too!",

			description : "Is not easy to develop a project from scratch from just images that the client needed in a short period of time. The reason? They lost their past platform due to a lack of backup and losting their host providers. I was encomended to develop the site that looked completely the same as the original one. In my way developing it, I asked the client if they wanted some changes or improvements on it that I added, like a fixed menu bar and a parallax effect on the background image, but everything else should stay the same.",

This one was of my first projects developing on the WordPress platform, but that didn't mean I wouldn't do my best. It was a lot of research and learning (sorry, newbie...) but at the end I delivered this site, it integrates a first page that welcomes any visitor and explains the company and it have a subdomain that manages all the real state functionality.",

			description : "In the summer of 2016 I went in an intership to Lima, Peru. There I met X-Shirt, a startup trying to make a change in the value chain, mainly with the cotton products, where all receive what they deserve. I loved their idea when I understood completely what they wanted to acheive (search for them! You'll love them too!). Now they aren't called X-Shirt, they changed their name to World Trade Fibers. The platform I developed with them unfortunately is down :( but is nothing bad, because it changed to a new, more robust, scalable and better platform! And the best of all... I'm part of that improvement! If you try to go to A-Shirt (old platform), it will redirect you to the new one, try it, or save it for when you see it in other of my developed projects ;)",

I did my best trying to make the site, unfortunately (I don't know if the client found out that they didn't needed a website or they tried something else to reach their market), they shut down the site :( I'm sad because I liked the site, it was cool... I promise! But it was just online like 6 months.",

After I return to Mexico to continue my studies, my old boss called me and asked me if I don't wanted to continue working with them... online! I was really happy to hear that, because is one of the reasons I chose this degree: so I could work to anyone anywhere. For this project it was different than the first one, now I had more experience so I was leading the development team for launching the site, using A-Shirt platform as a model. At the end, this site had the same end as A-Shirt (they died for a better cause). Now, this link also redirect to a section of the new site... is your choice, check it out now or wait to see it later in my portfolio ;)",
